# Code of Conduct

[English][canonical] | [中文-中国][zh-CN]

## Basic policies

This project adapts the popular [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)](policies/coc-contributor-covenant.md) in the open-source software community. 

## STAND NOTHING additional policy

We believe it's not an open-source project's ethnic responsibility to involve complicated economic and political situations, or it will eventually ruin the collaboration of the community. 

We consider this project politically neutral and __WE STAND WITH NOTHING__. Not any countries, religions, political forces, races, sexual preferences, or anything else. Nothing. 

We consider it a legitimate right to support anything but make it away from this project. Anyone who tries to enforce or seeks privileges by standing for ANYTHING will be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.

## Countries and territories policy

This project endorses [ISO 3166][iso-3166] as the list and names of worldwide countries and territories. Translations and abbreviations must not compromise the original canonical name.
