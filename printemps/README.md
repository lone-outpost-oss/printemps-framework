# `printemps`: Runner for the Printemps Web Framework

The runtime for running a Printemps web application.

 > [__Printemps__](https://www.printempsframework.org/) is the next-generation web framework which utilizes the [MoonBit language](https://www.moonbitlang.com/) and WebAssembly runtime.
 > 
 > Aims on enhancing application safety, development experiment, observability and flexibility, all without compromising performance. 

## For Printemps users

This is just a runner, not the framework itself.

Most users don't need Rust knowledge to use Printemps, hence have no need to deal with this repository. 
 
To build your Printemps web application, see the [MoonBit language guides](https://www.moonbitlang.com/docs/syntax) and Printemps guides (not ready yet).
